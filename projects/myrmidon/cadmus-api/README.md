# CadmusApi

- ðŸ“¦ `@myrmidon/cadmus-api`

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.0.

This library contains all the services linked to the Cadmus backend API, with their models, unless they are more generic models defined in the core library.

Note that all the services assume that the base URI is defined via `EnvService` with a key equal to `apiUrl`.
