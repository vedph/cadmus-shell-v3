# Cadmus Shell V3

This is the third iteration of [Cadmus](https://myrmex.github.io/overview/cadmus) frontend refactoring. This app is used as a shell for developing core UI components and generic part editors. All the libraries in V3 have been bumped to **major version 8**.

1. [original shell app](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus_shell): this was a draft.
2. [version 1](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus-shell): this is obsolete.
3. [version 2](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus-shell-2): this is a production version.
4. version 3 is this version. It has been cloned from V2, with upgrade to [V2 bricks](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus-bricks-shell-v2#migration-from-v1), which affected only a subset of the libraries. Yet, to ensure compatibility I have created a new repository so that existing Cadmus apps can continue to refer to V2 until they upgrade.

üêã Quick Docker image build:

1. `npm run build-lib`;
2. update version in `env.js` (and Docker files), and then `ng build --configuration=production`;
3. `docker build . -t vedph2020/cadmus-shell:8.0.2 -t vedph2020/cadmus-shell:latest` (replace with the current version).

## History

- 2024-05-14: updated packages and Angular.
- 2024-05-02: added plugins support to note editor.

### 8.0.2

- 2024-04-30:
  - updated packages.
  - Docker compose fixes.

### 8.0.1

- 2024-04-30:
  - added plugins support to comment editor.
  - updated Angular.
- 2024-04-13: **V3 shell**:
  - migrated to [V2 bricks](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus-bricks-shell-v2#migration-from-v1). All the libraries of V2 repository start from version number 5.x.x and have dropped modules, thus using standalone components, directives, and pipes.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è replaced `ngx-monaco-editor-v2` and `ngx-markdown` with NG essentials, affecting:
    - `@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-ui` and `@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-pg` (for comment, note, token text). These were bumped to version 8.0.0.
    - `@myrmidon/cadmus-part-philology-ui` and `@myrmidon/cadmus-part-philology-ui` (for witnesses). These were bumped to version 8.0.0.
    - `@myrmidon/cadmus-ui`: here Monaco dependency was no longer needed and has been removed.

- 2024-03-23:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è removed rangy replaced with vanilla JS (`@myrmidon/cadmus-core` bumped to major version 7.0.0). This removes a legacy depenency which also caused issues in newer Angular 17-based apps.
  - added `forChild` to `MarkdownModule` in general and philology parts (`@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-ui`, `@myrmidon/cadmus-part-philology-ui`).
- 2024-03-21:
  - updated Angular and packages.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è replaced `ngx-monaco-editor` with [ngx-monaco-editor-v2](https://github.com/miki995/ngx-monaco-editor-v2).
  - updated version for `@myrmidon/cadmus-ui` (6.0.1), `@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-ui` (7.0.1), `@myrmidon/cadmus-part-philology-ui` (6.0.1) affected by Monaco editor change.
- 2023-11-21:
  - added optional `settings` to `PartDefinition` and honored the optionality of other properties in it. This way, your editor can now access part definition settings for editors via `AppRepository`. Affected libraries: `@myrmidon/cadmus-api`, `@myrmidon/cadmus-core`, `@myrmidon/cadmus-item-editor`, `@myrmidon/cadmus-item-search`.
- 2023-11-17:
  - more load methods added to app state (`@myrmidon/cadmus-state`).
  - update app state flags on flags saved (`@myrmidon/cadmus-flags-ui`).
  - update app state thesauri on thesauri saved (`@myrmidon/cadmus-thesaurus-editor`).

---

### 7.0.0

- 2023-11-09: ‚ö†Ô∏è upgraded to Angular 17.
- 2023-11-06: added **flags editor** route and page. To opt in to use a flags editor:

1. `npm i @myrmidon/cadmus-flags-ui @myrmidon/cadmus-flags-pg --force`
2. add this route to your app routes:

```ts
// cadmus - flags
{
  path: 'flags',
  loadChildren: () =>
    import('@myrmidon/cadmus-flags-pg').then(
      (module) => module.CadmusFlagsPgModule
    ),
},
```

3. add a menu for that route in `app.component.html` (flags editing is reserved to admin users only), e.g. (including thesauri and flags in the same menu):

```html
<!-- profile menu -->
<ng-container *ngIf="user && (user.roles.includes('admin') || user.roles.includes('editor'))">
  <button type="button" mat-button [matMenuTriggerFor]="profileMenu">
    Profile
  </button>
  <mat-menu #profileMenu>
    <a mat-menu-item routerLink="/flags"> Flags </a>
    <a mat-menu-item routerLink="/thesauri"> Thesauri </a>
  </mat-menu>
</ng-container>
```

- 2023-11-04: added `addFlags` to API service.

- 2023-10-31:
  - updated Angular and packages.
  - fixed missing `@Output` decorator in an event in a thesaurus list component.

RouterModule.forRoot(routes, {
  initialNavigation: 'enabledBlocking',
  useHash: true,
}),
```

  - updated Angular.
  - updated packages (`@myrmidon/cadmus-graph-ui-ex`).
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 2023-10-03: removed ELF dependencies. For trivial repositories like this, we can dispose of more powerful libraries and just use vanilla Angular. This makes the UI more robust and easier to use for newcomers.

- 2023-09-24:
  - added upload service to `@myrmidon/cadmus-api`.
  - added thesaurus download and thesauri import to thesaurus list in `@myrmidon/cadmus-thesaurus-list`. Note that for importing you must opt-in by setting an env variable like this: `window.__env.thesImportEnabled = true;`. At any rate, import is available only to admin users. To enable import on the server side, be sure to import `Cadmus.Api.Controllers.Import` in your API project.
  - fixes to list layout in `@myrmidon/cadmus-item-list`.
  - fixes to list layout in `@myrmidon/cadmus-item-search`.

### 6.0.1

- 2023-06-16:
  - updated Angular.
  - refactored Docker compose script for PostgreSQL.
- 2023-05-26:
  - fix default facet in new item.
  - removed stale code from events.
  - refactored event editor for related entities.
- 2023-05-25: fix validation in triple editor (conditional validator did not work because control value was not up to date when evaluating).

### 6.0.0

- ‚ö†Ô∏è 2023-05-22: breaking changes for parts using the new [asserted composite ID](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus-bricks-shell/blob/master/projects/myrmidon/cadmus-refs-asserted-ids/README.md#asserted-composite-id):
  - refactored _pin links part_ and _pin links fragment_ (`@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-ui`, `@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-pg`: bump version to 6.0.0): links are now of type `AssertedCompositeId` (from bricks).
  - refactored related entity ID for _historical events part_: ID now is an `AssertedCompositeId` rather than a string.
  - refactored comments for _comments part and fragment_: `externalIds` (an array of items of type `AssertedId`) now is `links`, an array of items of type `AssertedCompositeId`.

### 5.0.0

- 2023-05-19:
  - preserve content for graph page in `CadmusGraphPgEx`.
  - added move to source capability to `CadmusGraphPgEx`.
- 2023-05-16: updated source type filters in graph UI (`@myrmidon/cadmus-graph-ui`).
- 2023-05-11: updated to Angular 16.
- 2023-04-28: added `this.roleIdInThesauri = true;` to comment, names, and note parts.
- 2023-04-21: added `this.roleIdInThesauri = true;` to the historical events part, thus enabling it to have role-dependent thesauri like the categories part.

### 4.1.0

- 2023-03-11:
  - moved imaging parts (gallery image annotations part) out of general parts into its own library, removing unnecessary packages from this demo.
  - better UI layout in categories and index keywords.
- 2023-03-07: updated packages.

### 4.0.12

- 2023-03-02:
  - added gallery image annotations part, using the [image gallery bricks](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus-bricks-shell/blob/master/projects/myrmidon/cadmus-img-gallery/README.md). In the demo shell I added new modules (`CadmusImgAnnotatorModule`, `CadmusImgGalleryModule`) and an `img_anno_eid` index lookup definition to let users play with references to image annotations via EID. Also, the gallery requires additional injection providers in `app.module`, and the following libraries:
    - `@myrmidon/cadmus-img-annotator` (brick)
    - `@myrmidon/cadmus-img-gallery` (brick)
    - `@recogito/annotorious` which also requires adding CSS to `angular.json`.
  - updated Angular.
- 2023-02-27:
  - added `tag` to historical event.
  - added feature: role ID suffix for thesauri (in `edit-part-feature-base.ts`): this is a new opt-in mechanism by which a part can request its thesauri IDs to be suffixed by its role ID (preceded by underscore). The categories part now opts into this new mechanism, so that you can have multiple categories parts each with its own, distinct set of categories. To opt in, just add `this.roleIdInThesauri = true;` in your feature component constructor: the part will then request suffixed thesauri. For instance, the categories part, which requests a `categories` thesaurus, when having a role equal to `eras` will rather request a `categories_eras` thesaurus to the server. Still, the returned set key will not change: its name will still be `categories`, so that the part code is not broken, but in fact the content of the thesaurus was got from `categories_eras` (which is still the ID of the thesaurus keyed under `categories`). If some of the requested thesauri need not to change, just add an alias thesaurus with the role suffix, pointing to the original thesaurus.
- 2023-02-26: multiple chronotopes in historical event (`@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-ui`).
- 2023-02-24: added pin links fragment layer (`@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-ui` and (`@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-pg`)).
- 2023-02-22:
  - updated Angular.
  - fix to event editor: relation reset when picking lookup item (`@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-ui`).
- 2023-02-17:
  - edited node as a bindable property in graph node list (`@myrmidon/cadmus-graph-ui`).
  - refactored API graph service (`@myrmidon/cadmus-api`).
  - replaced graph lookup component with the generic lookup brick (`@myrmidon/cadmus-graph-ui`; added `GraphNodeLookupService`).
- 2023-02-15: added optional `tag` to pin links part entries (`@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-ui` and `@myrmidon/cadmus-part-general-pg`).

### 4.0.11

- 2023-02-15: improvements to graph UI.
- 2023-02-14:
  - updated Angular and packages.
  - clear user list cache on new registered user in `RegisterUserPageComponent`.

  - cut tail `.-` in filtering related event thesauri.

### 4.0.10

- 2023-02-06: changes to binding in bibliography-entry; chronotopes-part; comment-editor; doc-references-part; external-ids-part; historical-date-part; historical-event-editor; index-keyword; tiled-data; quotation-entry. These reflect the new bricks (mostly assertions or chronotopes), whose binding has been fixed so that now the initial-property hack is no more required.
- 2023-02-03:

- 2023-01-24: added lookup to historical event editor. To test this, just add an `eid` metadatum to an item's metadata part, and then in another item events part refer to its value via lookup.
- 2023-01-22: changed historical events part related events thesaurus so that it uses `:` as separator.
- 2023-01-20: updated Angular and packages.

### 4.0.1

- 2022-11-30:
  - fixes to `@myrmidon/cadmus-ui` and `@myrmidon/cadmus-state` for newly created parts.
  - allow `null` in `updateForm` part/fragment editors to make TS compiler happy.

### 4.0.0

- 2022-11-30:
  - **breaking change**: renamed thesaurus `categories` as `comment-categories` for comment part/fragment. This allows using different categories for comments and categories parts. Should you need to use the same categories, just create a thesaurus alias.
  - removed `@angular/flex-layout` from `@myrmidon/cadmus-graph-ui`, `@myrmidon/cadmus-item-editor`, `@myrmidon/cadmus-item-list`, `@myrmidon/cadmus-item-search`, `@myrmidon/cadmus-thesaurus-list`, `@myrmidon/cadmus-thesaurus-ui`, tiled text layer part and token text layer part.

The following history refers to version 1.

### 3.1.5

- 2022-11-03:
  - updated Angular and packages.
  - fixes to events editor.
  - hierarchical thesauri for events and relations in events editor. When specified, selecting an event type triggers filtering of relations according to the selected ID prefix. This is equal to the ID of the selected entry up to the last dot, i.e. from event type `person.crm:E67_birth` we filter all the relation entries starting with `person.`. This allows different granularity levels in filtering: for instance, should we have `person.birth.crm:E67_birth` (prefix `person.birth.`), we could have two relation entries `person.birth.P96_by_mother` and `person.birth.P97_from_father`, which are available only when a person's birth event is selected (rather than just a person's event). If no thesauri are specified, you can just fill the IDs without constraints.

### 3.1.4

- 2022-10-25:
  - in `@myrmidon/cadmus-core` fix to `textLayerService.selHasAnySpan`: check for SPAN element did not stop when adding a new selection and another selection in the context of the same ancestor is found after the insertion point.
  - updated `rangy` to 1.3.1.
  - updated Angular.

### 3.1.3

- 2022-10-10:
  - preview samples fixes.

- 2022-09-14: updated Angular.

### 3.1.1

- 2022-08-21: added matching mode to flags in items filter, API service, and core models. Now items can be filtered by flags not only by looking at all the flags set, but also to any flag set, all flags clear, and any flags clear. Affected libraries:
  - cadmus-core
  - cadmus-api
  - cadmus-state
  - cadmus-item-list
  - cadmus-item-editor
- 2022-08-08:
  - added preview service to `cadmus-api` and increased its version number.
  - added preview keys to app state in `cadmus-state` and increased its version number.
  - added preview button in item editor when preview is available (`cadmus-item-editor`).

  - added `cadmus-preview-ui` and `cadmus-preview-pg`.
- 2022-08-07: updated Angular.
- 2022-08-05: thesauri names for proper names/chronotopes.

### 3.1.0

- 2022-08-02: fixes to `HistoricalEventEditor` and `NamesPartComponent`. Minor fix to `ThesaurusTreeComponent` template (removed redundant `?`).
- 2022-07-30: raised length limits for apparatus fragment notes.
- 2022-07-19: historical event editor fixes.
- 2022-07-14: updated Angular.
- 2022-07-10: updated Angular.

  - upgraded Angular to 13.3.5.
  - fixed item editor flags on logout/login.
  - fixed item search layout.
- 2022-03-19: removed moment and fixes to metadata part editor. Libraries affected: cadmus-item-editor, cadmus-item-list, cadmus-item-search, cadmus-part-general-ui, cadmus-ui.

### 2.0.1

- 2022-03-10: upgraded Angular to 13.2.6.
- added in `tsconfig.json` `"allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true` in order to work around [this issue](https://github.com/urish/ngx-moment/issues/275) in `ngx-moment`.

### 2.0.0

- 2022-03-01: upgraded Angular to 13.2.4.
- 2022-02-13: `ModelEditorComponentBase`: internally access `model` via private member rather than property setter/getter. Using the setter would unnecessarily trigger `onModelSet`.
- 2022-01-31: removed `DocReference`, `PhysicalDimension` and `PhysicalSize` interfaces from models (these are now in bricks). Upgraded Angular to 13.2.0.
- 2022-01-16: added `ChronotopesPart` to `cadmus-part-general-ui` and `cadmus-part-general-pg`. Image: 2.0.1.
- 2022-01-04: added `MetadataPart` to `cadmus-part-general-ui` and `cadmus-part-general-pg`. Removed physical size from `cadmus-ui` (now moved to bricks), increasing `cadmus-ui` version to 2.0.0.
- 2021-12-20: upgraded Angular and fixed ID passed via `getItemLayerInfo` in state library.
- 2021-12-18: recreated an Angular 13.0.4 workspace and moved old shell libraries into it while refactoring:
  - auth-related libraries replaced with `@myrmidon/auth-jwt-login` and `@myrmidon/auth-jwt-admin`.
  - base model editor slightly refactored to use new services.
  - generic models and their editors replaced with bricks.
  - comment part and fragment now uses `ExternalId`'s for IDs rather than an array of strings. This is also reflected in the backend models (`Cadmus.Parts` from version 2.7.0, `Cadmus.Seed.Parts` from version 1.5.0).
  - Cadmus material removed, and replaced by more granular imports in each Material consumer.
