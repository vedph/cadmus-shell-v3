You are an Angular expert specializing in signal-based reactive programming. Please analyze the provided Angular component code for potential infinite loop bugs related to signals and effects.

Look for these specific anti-patterns that cause infinite loops:

1. **Effect Reading Its Own Written Signals**: Check if any `effect()` function reads signals that are modified by code called within the same effect (directly or indirectly).

2. **Signal Reads in Methods That Modify Signals**: Look for methods that both read and write to signals, especially:

   - Reading `busy()` or loading state signals in methods that set those same signals
   - Reading data signals in methods that update those signals
   - Any pattern where a signal is read in a conditional that also modifies that signal

3. **Double Initialization**: Check if both constructor effects and lifecycle hooks (ngOnInit, ngAfterViewInit) are calling the same initialization methods.

4. **Re-entry Issues**: Look for async operations (HTTP calls, observables) that don't properly prevent re-entry when the component state changes.

5. **Effect Dependency Cycles**: Identify if effects are creating dependency chains where Effect A triggers Effect B which triggers Effect A.

For each issue found, provide:

- The specific code location
- Why it causes an infinite loop
- A suggested fix using flags, computed signals, or restructured logic

Focus particularly on:

- `effect()` callbacks and what signals they read vs. write
- Methods called from effects that modify signals
- Async operations that update signals read by effects
- Loading/busy state management patterns

Please analyze the component and report any potential infinite loop risks.
