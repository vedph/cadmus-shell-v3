Check that this Angular component has been properly refactored to use signals and observables for a fully reactive state, so it can be migrated to `OnPush` change detection strategy.

To do this, review this Angular component, ensuring the following:

- use reactive forms, signals, or observables (any mixture of them is valid) for all reactive state. There should be no left public variable which is not part of a reactive form, a signal, or an observable.
- use computed signals for derived state.
- as many signals were refactored from simple variables, ensure that in the template and in the rest of the component's code all references to these variables are updated to use signal accessors (e.g., `mySignal()`). This is important, because TypeScript will not flag these as errors, but they will lead to runtime issues as they miss the brackets which invoke the function. So, every variable which has been refactored into a signal might still be lurking in the template without the brackets, like `busy` instead of `busy()` after refactoring `public busy = false;` into `public readonly busy = signal<boolean>(false);`.
- legacy decorators `@Input`/`@Output` must not be present; they should have been replaced with `input()`/`output()` functions.
- detect `ngClass`/`ngStyle` usage so that they can be converted into `[class]` and `[style].
- detect any mutable state (e.g., direct object mutation). Change detection is based on object _reference_ checks, so mutable patterns will lead to bugs. We must be sure to catch and fix them all. Be careful to detect changes inside objects or arrays.
- in templates, there must be only the modern Angular `@if`/`@for` and the like, instead of `*ngIf`/`*ngFor`, etc.
- when a component is editing a list of items, and passes via binding the item to edit to a child component (e.g. `this.edited.set(...)`), ensure that the object being passed is deeply cloned first, via `deepCopy` (e.g. `this.edited.set(deepCopy(objectToEdit))`). This is essential for the child editor to be notified of a new item to edit.

Please notice that:

- I am using reactive forms, without wrapping them into signals, because they are reactive anyway, and I am waiting for the release of signal-based forms to replace them. So, until then we are fine with reactive forms, provided that there are no issues in their usage (especially in avoiding object mutation).
- I am not yet setting `changeDetection` strategy to `OnPush` in this component; this will happen at a later refactoring stage. Just ensure that the component state is fully reactive, whether it uses reactive forms, observables, signals, or any combination of them.
